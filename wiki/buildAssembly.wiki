= Introduction =

The control library is compiled in to an assembly [http://code.google.com/p/winforms-geplugin-control-library/source/browse/trunk#trunk/bin/Release FC.GEPluginCtrls.dll] and it is this dynamic linking library (DLL) is linked to your program at run time.

There are a number of ways you can obtain the library.

 * You can download the c# solution file and build the assembly using Visual Studio. This will do everything for you. Just load the solution and hit F5.

 * You can build the Interop.GEPlugin.dll manually using [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tt0cf3sx(VS.80).aspx tlbimp.exe]^1^ and then add it as a reference to the FC.GEPluginCtrls.dll assembly. To do this you would build the FC.GEPluginCtrls.dll using [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/78f4aasd.aspx csc.exe].^2^

 * You can just download the latest versions from the [http://code.google.com/p/winforms-geplugin-control-library/source/browse/trunk#trunk/bin/Release Release folder]

^1^ _You can download the [http://code.google.com/p/winforms-geplugin-control-library/downloads/detail?name=buildInterop.bat buildInterop.bat] file for this 

^2^ _I have more detailed notes on this process, as well as .bat file, I will upload these soon._
